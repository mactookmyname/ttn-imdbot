# ttn-imdbot
A bot which runs on thetreesnetwork to display information from imdb.

## TODO
* Handle titles with multiple imdb results e.g. _Halloween_
* Add support for writer, actor, directors, etc
* If we don't find a description with one search (movie, series) try the other, e.g. _American Ninja Warrior_
* Sometimes can't get parental guide data, e.g. _Signs_, _Shallow Hal_
